1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. Answer : 59 for 5%

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

A. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

The sample size for a large population would require a larger sample size such as 299 for an infinite population.

B. 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample for a large population would require a smaller sample size such as 229 for an infinite population.

The higher prevalence reduces the sample size for part be.

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_\_ (\<,=,\>) \_\_\_\_%

Answer: \<1%

3/300 = 0.01 so 1%

	1	Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host

False: The following statement is false because microparasites do not reproduce within the host. They are small with reproduction rate and their numbers increase inside the host, usually causing short lived but sometimes severe infections. Macroparasites don't multiply within the host, they produce eggs that leave the host, making their numbers constant. 
	2	False: This statement is false because disease models are too simple and do not account for the many factors that affect real host-pathogen systems. The epidemiological trait only represents one system, and not the others that theoretically exist. Most pathogens are multi-host, infecting different species. Hosts can also be infected by multiple pathogens at once, causing different effects. 
	3	False. This statement is false because Chaga is a vector-borne disease. Not all infectious diseases are contagious such as tetanus and malaria. 
	4	False. This statement is false because epizootic hemorrhagic disease does not always cause severe outbreaks. This depends on a location as well as deer immunity in that area. While some populations can recover from epizootic hemorrhagic disease, others have high mortality rates. 
	5	False. The white-tailed deer are infected and infectious. They would not be diseased because the pathogen is not causing harm and the deers are not experiencing symptoms. The deers are considered infected because they carry the pathogen and they are considered infectious because they can infect other deer when they shed the pathogen in their secretions.
	6	False. HPS is not transmitted to humans by a vector. Rodent droppings (feces) are responsible for the transmission of the disease. Humans can get the disease from inhalation, indirect, and direct contact with the secretions.

 
2. Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease. 
Prevalence is the number of affected individuals over the total number of individuals. It focuses on existing cases whereas incidence focuses on new cases. Incidence is the number of new cases of disease during a fixed time period, over the number of animals at risk of developing disease. The key difference is that the denominator only reflects those at risk.

5.
	1	Measles : It is in days and the formula uses weeks so 8 days is 1.14 weeks.
1/1.14 = 0.877 per week 
	2	Rotavirus : .50 : 1/infectious period so …
½  = .50 per weeks

	3	Measles : β = 15 x 0.877 = 13.16 per week
Rotavirus : β =17x 0.5 = 8.5 per week
	4	= 15x (1 − 0.8) = 15 x 0.2 = 3


6. 
	1	Infected but not diseased: 
This is possible because a host can carry the disease but not show symptoms or clinical signs. White tailed deer are a great example of this system because when infected with brain worms, they can carry the parasite but not present any clinical signs.
	2	Infected but not diseased. 
This system is possible because a host can be infected and show signs of disease. This is observed with many diseases. An example could be Streptococcus pneumoniae. This pathogen is usually presented with a diseased state where humans experience symptoms of disease.
	3	Not infected but diseased. 
This system is not possible because in order for a host to be diseased, it must be infected. With no infection, they are not diseased.

7. 
Campylobacteriosis: 2-7 days 
Norovirus gastroenteritis: 12-72 hours 
8. In 2015 the Saiga antelope landscape dropped when over 200,000 animals died within hours.This was due to a bacterial disease found in the nasal passage of the antelopes. The bacteria was always there but due to livestock stress the bacteria became pathogenic. This info was not sufficient and scientists figured it was due to an environmental factor. They found that a harmless vector conr=tributed to the mortality events and high temperatures were tracked days leading up to this event. It is also worth noting that females were under a huge amount of stress from pregnancy. This physiological stress made them more susceptible and contributed to the phenomenon. This case illustrated how a normal bacterium can become deadly under certain environmental and host stress. It may be difficult to control the environmental aspects of the issue, but there are things that can be done to prevent similar events. One way is vaccinating to reduce disease pressure and stress on wildlife populations. Effective monitoring of environmental conditions and animal health could predict similar risk periods.  Finally, in order to preserve wild Saiga antelope conservationists can try to reduce hunting of the species and protect their habitat. This will give the antelopes a chance to bounce back and reduce other threats like poaching.
9. I agree 100% with Aldo Leopold's statement because wildlife is not just about the pathogen or hosts biology but it is linked with ecological context. Climate change is a great example of how humans play a role in stressors in the environment. This can alter hibernation conditions and local ecosystems making animals more vulnerable. Saiga antelopes became deadly due to extreme environmental conditions, one of which was high temperatures. Human action has made climate change a large issue and it could potentially increase the frequency of such heat events. Another example of how human activities can play a role in disease dynamics is pathogens contaminating water due to runoff. Whether this is done by fecal matter or other contaminates, human activities have contributed to the spread of disease. 

10. 
Scenario
1 : R0=1
2 : R0=3
3 : R0=2
4 : R0=0
R0 is the basic reproduction number. It is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected person. In this case the infected person is red. In each scenario, it infects a certain amount of other flamingos in a fully susceptible population. If R0 is greater than 1 it is an outbreak. So in the case of R0 being 3, each infectious flamingo infects 3 others on average. This means the disease is spreading fast and is a potential outbreak . In the case of R0, there is no outbreak because they did not pass it along so the infection will die out if it was not spread.

 A. 
2015: 133 − 0 = 133
2016: 125 − 2 = 123
2017: 112 − 4 = 108
2018: 145 − 5 = 140 2019: 136 − 4 = 132
INCIDENCE 
2015: 4/133 = 0.030075 = 0.030
2016: 5/123 = 0.040650 = 0.041
2017: 8/108 = 0.074074 = 0.074 HIGHEST INCIDENCE
2018: 4/140 = 0.028571 = 0.029
2019: 2/132 = 0.015152 = 0.01

B. 
2015: 0+4 = 
2016: 2+5 = 7 2017: 4+8 = 12 2018: 5+4 = 9
2019: 4+2 = 6

PREVALENCE

2015: 4 ÷ 133 = 0.030075 ≈ 0.030 lowest PREVALENCE 
2016: 7 ÷ 125 = 0.056
2017: 12 ÷ 112 = 0.107143 ≈ 0.107 highest PREVALENCE
2018: 9 ÷ 145 = 0.062069 ≈ 0.062
2019: 6 ÷ 136 = 0.044118 ≈ 0.044

12. 
Heard immunity threshold : 1 - 1/R0
	•	1-⅓= 1-0.3333 = 0.6667
66.7% of population needs to be immune to prevent the outbreak
Total immune needed : 0.6667x5400 = 3600
Immune seals = 1080
So 3600-1080 = 2520 need to be vaccinated

1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. 
False: It is maintain in camels being that it is a zoonotic diseease. 

2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
True. Camels are the brdige to humans and is known to be the major route of transmission. 

3. Hyumans are dead end hosts for MERS-CoV.
False. Humans are the transiemt host. There is limited human to human transfer. Humans are technically not dead end host because humans can not sustain the pathogen. There is human to human transmission occasionally. Therefore not every human infection is a dead end.

4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-Cov infections is approx. 65%.
False. The CDC stated that it is approx. 35% with limited household and healthcare transmission (CDC). There is no further evidence that backs up the claim that it is 65%. 

5. The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak.
False. It is a sporadic spillover from camels to humans. A point source is not the pattern that this disease follows. it is described more as a propagated outbreak with cases sporadically occuring. 

6. Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occured? Discuss possible ecological epidemiological and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend. 
It could be possible that people are aware of the infection since scientist and experts know about its transmission. It is likely that high risk individuals protect themselves when working with camels that could potentially be exposed to MERS. Better precautions are likely being taken now and camels are also being protected through vaccines, etc. Healthcare workers could have learned how to properly use PPE to protect themselves from picking up the virus.

Worksheet 7
1. Nipah virus ecology varies across regions; resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bandladesh. Describe how the modes fo transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these difference influence the preventative measures reccomended in each setting. 

In Malaysia there are two pathways in which transmission occurs. The bats partially eats on a fruit and leaves the virus in it. Then an animal like a pig eats it and people working close get infected. This can shape preventation by increasing protection for humans working with pigs. They can also protect pigs from infected bats species and limiting their interaction wtih bats and fruits they feed on. Overall, more straitgies can be in place for livestock management. 

In Bangladesh there is one pathway where bats urinate or leave feces in pots and then humans consume and gets the virus. Preventative stratigies include managing pots or finding a way to purify sap. They can also encourage beteer protocol for retrieving sap from pots. 

2. Avian reoviruses can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population. 

Horizontal transmission route of ARV include birds consuming virus shed in contaminated feces, water, or food (fomites). It can be vertically spread when birds pass it to their eggs. Environmental factors favoring transmission include large population of flocks and poor sanitation. Higher temperatures are also great environments for transmission. ARV does not have a lipid envolope making it tolerant of different temperatures and able to withstand sanitization.Bird flu is caused by AVR and spreads within birds, poultry, and other animals. When an ourbreak occurs it increases its risk to infect humans but it is known for impacted food supply be reducing it. 

3. Langya henipavirus is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in china. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potentional EID? 

Langya's likely reservoir is shrews. Transmission route is humans get infected through direct or indirect contact with an infected animal or their body fluid . It is considered a spill over because there is no evidence of human to human transmission. It is a zoonotic event with low pandemic potentional.

The overall prevalence using Sterne Cl. There are 61 total racoons and 29 are infected. The prevalence is 47.2% and interval 0.251-0.999. Prevalence by region include, North: 28.6% , Central: 64.3%, South: 62.8%. It is possible that regional patterns and temperatures associated with prevalence. When specific sex is compared with regions here are the results: 
Central and Female: 100% with a Sterne Cl: 0.0.549. 
Central and Male: 44.4% with a Sterne Cl: 0.118-1.00 
South x Female: 100% with Sterne Cl: 0-0.762
South x Male : 50.0% with Sterne Cl: 0.293-1.00
North x Females: 38.1% with Sterne Cl: 0-0.644
North x Males: 21.4% with Sterne Cl: 0-1.00
In South and Central regions, females have high prevalence. 
When age is compared with region, we see higher prevalence in adults in Southern and Central regions. In the North, this is not a big deal because overall prevalence is low. 

Based on these results, South and Central regions exhibit high prevalence. This could mean that the pathogen is in higher counts and transmission is more likely there. Females are also more prone to infections in these regions. This could be significant but I think the population tested could be larger. Overall the prevalence is moderately high. Adults have higher prevalence compared to younger adults. 

Fisher results confirmed the same ideas based on prevalence. South and Central have significantly higher infectious rates than the North. The p-value for North and Central is 0.00256. This is a significant value being that it is less than 0.05 and Central also has a higher prevalence. South and Central have a p value of 1.0 meaning there is no significant differnece. North and South have a p value 0.00151 meaning that there is a significance.

Worksheet 9 

1. In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behavoirs contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identity at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection? 

During the Salmonella outbreak of 2024, humans contributed greatly to the spread of the outbreak. One factors was bad hygeine by not washing hands after handling poultry. As with anything else, clean hands are important especially when engaging with animals. It limits the spread of disease and from person to person. This aided in the spread because indiivudals likely touched their mouth and other surfaces, transferring the pathogen. The best practice is to maintain clean conditions by properly washing hands and surfaces. It important to use antimicrobial soap and to wash hands with warm water to eliminate the spread of disease.   Another issue that contributed to the spread of Salmonella was the mishandling birds and using them as pets. It was reported that children had close contact with the flocks. The flocks were also reported to come in and out of the home, aiding in the spread of Salmonella. Our homes are our safe space and introducing bacteria into areas where we eat and sleep can increase chances of catching disease. The birds likely brushed their bodies on surfaces, lefts behind droppings, or even spread the pathogen through human when they were introduced into the house. In the case of the children using flocks as pets, they likely rubbed the birds and cuddled them. This increased the spread because feathers rubbed their face transmitting the disease to them. Ourbreaks are strongly tied to close contact and contamination. It is important to maintain clean environments to prevent the spread of future disease. 


2. Tall fecus grass is commonly infected with a fungal edophyte that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock. 
a. What advantages does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte? 

Some advantages of being infected with a fungal endophyte is that insects are resistant to it and they have enhanced drought tolerance. The fecue shows greater resistance to heat, overgrazing, and environment stress. Since they are in areas with high temperatres the fungal endophyte helps with those elevated conditions. 


b. What enivronmental and ecological factors drive the occurence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 

Environmental and ecological factors strongly influence the occurence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems. Environmental stress causes increaese in ergot alkaloids production. This raises the risk of toxicosis in cattle. This can be due to drought and high temperatrues. Large concentrations of endophytic tall fescue leads to more alkalids and more exposure. When the forage is infected the cattle consume higher levels of ergovaline. Season patterns play a role in its severity because during late spring through fall, alkaloid concentrations ride because seed tissue has the highest alkaoid levels. 



c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 

Endophyte in greater concentration in reproductive organs. Cattles not able to gain weight is an indicator of fescue toxicity. Body response to the heat is also a sign. These include, elevated body temperature, fast breathing, and reduced grazing activity. Alkaoids reduce prolactin levels, cuasing poor lactation and hair less. In major cases, vasoconstriction can lead to lamenss or even necrosis also known as fescue foot.

Subject: Mood Overview and Strategic Response Recommendations 

This memo will explain Mpox, highlighting its impact and offering actionable recommendations in order to aid in preparedness and strategic response within the state level. This discussion will incorporate disease ecology principles, emphasizing host-pathogen interaction and 

Background on Mpox
Mpox previously called Monkeypox is an Orthopoxvirus whose primary reservoir is thought to be a rodent found in Africa. The virus has two clades (Clade I and 2), each with two distinct subclades. Although Mpox is not a widespread threat in the United States, it caused a notable outbreak in 2022. In response, the CDC ramped up diagnostic testing and vaccinations to reduce the spread. ​​The CDC’s responses addressed health equity and pushed the importance of surveillance and testing. 
A.Transmission Pathway
Animal to Human: Transmitted from contact with infected animals; e.g. scratches, secretions. 
This highlights the classic host-pathogen spillover where ecological interaction between human and reservoir species allows the virus to spread across species. 
Human to Human:  Once the virus has spilled over into humans, humans are then able to spread it amongst each other. The virus can spread through droplets or by rash. Human to human transmission shows the shift from wildlife-linked spillover to sustained epidemic potential. 

B. Geographic Distribution
Mpox is endemic to regions of Central and West Africa.  Global travel has allowed the virus to appear in non-endemic regions. Recently in 2024, the WHO and Africa CDC issued emergency declarations due to a rise in cases and its expansion amongst geographic regions. This expansion underscores how environmental, ecological, and social factors can reshape pathogen distribution. 

C. Clinical Presentation 
Signs and symptoms typically begin 1 to 21 days after exposure to Monkeypox virus. The most prominent symptoms are skin rashes (papules) accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The rash typically begins on the face and spreads elsewhere on the body. This is not always the case and can also begin at the site of contact. 




D. Case Implication
An imported case into the United States could pose several potential interconnect risks for public health officials. The 2022 outbreak is a great example of how an individual case can create a major problem. this as it opens the door for:
	•	Risk of Transmission: A single case of Mpox can initiate human to human spread, especially in close contact networks. 
	•	Exposure Risk Among Healthcare Workers: Unknown cases can become a threat if improper PPE is used. 
	•	Potential of Outbreak: Cluster can emerge in areas where there is high physical contact. 
	•	Strain on Resources: If an outbreak occurs, extensive testing, vaccination efforts, and community outreach must be implemented. 

Guidelines and Recommendations 

Prevention
Mpox is preventable with a combination of vaccination and behavioral prevention. The recommended vaccine is JYNNEOS. It includes two doses that should be distributed four weeks apart. If exposed, an individual should seek medical attention and that case should be reported. In addition to the vaccine, one can limit skin-to-skin contact with other individuals that have unusual rashes or sores. Practicing good hygiene as well as cleaning and disinfecting frequently used surfaces can limit the spread. 

Management of Suspected Case
In order to protect those uninfected, the individual should immediately isolate and inform their healthcare physician. Appropriate diagnostic testing like PCR testing of lesions should be done and if results are positive, it should be reported. 

Disease Surveillance 
Disease surveillance is important for detecting and responding to outbreaks and epidemics. In regards to Mpox, is it crucial because of its spread across international borders through travel and wildlife. Effective surveillance requires organizations across the world to work together to create methods for reporting cases and sharing data. Monitoring trends and identifying threats could limit its transmission. 

Educating Healthcare Providers
Historically, Mpox carried social stigma which discouraged affected individuals from getting the hair they needed. Improved education can help recognize symptoms early and provide accurate diagnoses. Informed healthcare providers strengthen public health surveillance and is a powerful tool for controlling Mpox.

Worksheeet 10 

1. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

African Swine fevercan be transmitted in several different ways. The first is through directly through contacct with with infected salive, blood, urine, or feces. It can be transmitted indirectly when contaminated pork product is ingested. The virus can be passed through mechanical vectors like transport trucks, equpiment, and work clothing. It is also has insect-borne transmission. This occurs when ticks feed on infected pigs and spread the virus. Humans by being more than just a mechanical vector. They a play role in the spillover by transport. This is when pigs and pork products travel across bored. They also play a role in the spread due to feeding practices, illegal trade, and socioeconomic aspects. Poor surveillance can also increase the spread because of delayed detection in smallholder systems.

2. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus affects the severity progression and management of Chlamydia in kolas? 

KoRV causes an immunodeficiency virus and supresses immune system and makes Chlyamydia more severe in kolas. Kolas die at a higher rate and infertility rates decrease. The bacterial load is also higher because of the reduced immune response.  This issue is mulifactorial, which makes it harder to manage. Management of the disease must focus on addressing KoRV and Chlamydia. It should target infertilty, and help with elimnating the bacteria. 

3. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD) caused by Ophidomyces ophiodiicola is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease? 

Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola is a well adapted pathogen due to its ability to survive in the environment and its broad host range. However there is a lack of information about the disease and there is limited data on current trends. Additionally, diagnostic testing presents challenges including false negatives.
