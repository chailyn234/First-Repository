## First Assignment

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

**The epidemiological triad helps explain how diseases spread, but it only shows one pathway. There are three parts to it: the agent, the host, and the environment.**

1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. Answer : 59 for 5%

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

A. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

The sample size for a large population would require a larger sample size such as 299 for an infinite population.

B. 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample for a large population would require a smaller sample size such as 229 for an infinite population.

The higher prevalence reduces the sample size for part be.

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_\_ (\<,=,\>) \_\_\_\_%

Answer: \<1%

3/300 = 0.01 so 1%

Worksheet 3
1. A. Find the incidence on day 06/12/2025. 06/14/2025/. 06/15/2025
06/12/2025.  			6/56=0.107 new cases of elk per day 
06/14/2025/. 			2/43=0.0465 new cases of elk per day 
06/15/2025				0/41= 0 new cases of elk per day 

B. What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/2024 and 06/16/2025. What is the unit for prevalence ? 
06/13/2025			11 infected elk so 11/56= 0.196 cases per elk

	1	
	1	Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host

False: The following statement is false because microparasites do not reproduce within the host. They are small with reproduction rate and their numbers increase inside the host, usually causing short lived but sometimes severe infections. Macroparasites don't multiply within the host, they produce eggs that leave the host, making their numbers constant. 
	2	False: This statement is false because disease models are too simple and do not account for the many factors that affect real host-pathogen systems. The epidemiological trait only represents one system, and not the others that theoretically exist. Most pathogens are multi-host, infecting different species. Hosts can also be infected by multiple pathogens at once, causing different effects. 
	3	False. This statement is false because Chaga is a vector-borne disease. Not all infectious diseases are contagious such as tetanus and malaria. 
	4	False. This statement is false because epizootic hemorrhagic disease does not always cause severe outbreaks. This depends on a location as well as deer immunity in that area. While some populations can recover from epizootic hemorrhagic disease, others have high mortality rates. 
	5	False. The white-tailed deer are infected and infectious. They would not be diseased because the pathogen is not causing harm and the deers are not experiencing symptoms. The deers are considered infected because they carry the pathogen and they are considered infectious because they can infect other deer when they shed the pathogen in their secretions.
	6	False. HPS is not transmitted to humans by a vector. Rodent droppings (feces) are responsible for the transmission of the disease. Humans can get the disease from inhalation, indirect, and direct contact with the secretions.

 
2. Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease. 
Prevalence is the number of affected individuals over the total number of individuals. It focuses on existing cases whereas incidence focuses on new cases. Incidence is the number of new cases of disease during a fixed time period, over the number of animals at risk of developing disease. The key difference is that the denominator only reflects those at risk.

5.
	1	Measles : It is in days and the formula uses weeks so 8 days is 1.14 weeks.
1/1.14 = 0.877 per week 
	2	Rotavirus : .50 : 1/infectious period so …
½  = .50 per weeks

	3	Measles : β = 15 x 0.877 = 13.16 per week
Rotavirus : β =17x 0.5 = 8.5 per week
	4	= 15x (1 − 0.8) = 15 x 0.2 = 3


6. 
	1	Infected but not diseased: 
This is possible because a host can carry the disease but not show symptoms or clinical signs. White tailed deer are a great example of this system because when infected with brain worms, they can carry the parasite but not present any clinical signs.
	2	Infected but not diseased. 
This system is possible because a host can be infected and show signs of disease. This is observed with many diseases. An example could be Streptococcus pneumoniae. This pathogen is usually presented with a diseased state where humans experience symptoms of disease.
	3	Not infected but diseased. 
This system is not possible because in order for a host to be diseased, it must be infected. With no infection, they are not diseased.

Campylobacteriosis: 2-7 days 
Norovirus gastroenteritis: 12-72 hours 
8. In 2015 the Saiga antelope landscape dropped when over 200,000 animals died within hours.This was due to a bacterial disease found in the nasal passage of the antelopes. The bacteria was always there but due to livestock stress the bacteria became pathogenic. This info was not sufficient and scientists figured it was due to an environmental factor. They found that a harmless vector conr=tributed to the mortality events and high temperatures were tracked days leading up to this event. It is also worth noting that females were under a huge amount of stress from pregnancy. This physiological stress made them more susceptible and contributed to the phenomenon. This case illustrated how a normal bacterium can become deadly under certain environmental and host stress. It may be difficult to control the environmental aspects of the issue, but there are things that can be done to prevent similar events. One way is vaccinating to reduce disease pressure and stress on wildlife populations. Effective monitoring of environmental conditions and animal health could predict similar risk periods.  Finally, in order to preserve wild Saiga antelope conservationists can try to reduce hunting of the species and protect their habitat. This will give the antelopes a chance to bounce back and reduce other threats like poaching.
9. I agree 100% with Aldo Leopold's statement because wildlife is not just about the pathogen or hosts biology but it is linked with ecological context. Climate change is a great example of how humans play a role in stressors in the environment. This can alter hibernation conditions and local ecosystems making animals more vulnerable. Saiga antelopes became deadly due to extreme environmental conditions, one of which was high temperatures. Human action has made climate change a large issue and it could potentially increase the frequency of such heat events. Another example of how human activities can play a role in disease dynamics is pathogens contaminating water due to runoff. Whether this is done by fecal matter or other contaminates, human activities have contributed to the spread of disease.

Scenario
1 : R0=1
2 : R0=3
3 : R0=2
4 : R0=0
R0 is the basic reproduction number. It is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected person. In this case the infected person is red. In each scenario, it infects a certain amount of other flamingos in a fully susceptible population. If R0 is greater than 1 it is an outbreak. So in the case of R0 being 3, each infectious flamingo infects 3 others on average. This means the disease is spreading fast and is a potential outbreak . In the case of R0, there is no outbreak because they did not pass it along so the infection will die out if it was not spread. 

11.
 A. 
2015: 133 − 0 = 133
2016: 125 − 2 = 123
2017: 112 − 4 = 108
2018: 145 − 5 = 140 2019: 136 − 4 = 132
INCIDENCE 
2015: 4/133 = 0.030075 = 0.030
2016: 5/123 = 0.040650 = 0.041
2017: 8/108 = 0.074074 = 0.074 HIGHEST INCIDENCE
2018: 4/140 = 0.028571 = 0.029
2019: 2/132 = 0.015152 = 0.01

B. 
2015: 0+4 = 
2016: 2+5 = 7 2017: 4+8 = 12 2018: 5+4 = 9
2019: 4+2 = 6

PREVALENCE

2015: 4 ÷ 133 = 0.030075 ≈ 0.030 lowest PREVALENCE 
2016: 7 ÷ 125 = 0.056
2017: 12 ÷ 112 = 0.107143 ≈ 0.107 highest PREVALENCE
2018: 9 ÷ 145 = 0.062069 ≈ 0.062
2019: 6 ÷ 136 = 0.044118 ≈ 0.044

12. 
Heard immunity threshold : 1 - 1/R0
	•	1-⅓= 1-0.3333 = 0.6667
66.7% of population needs to be immune to prevent the outbreak
Total immune needed : 0.6667x5400 = 3600
Immune seals = 1080
So 3600-1080 = 2520 need to be vaccinated

1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. 
False: It is maintain in camels being that it is a zoonotic diseease. 

2. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
True. Camels are the brdige to humans and is known to be the major route of transmission. 

3. Hyumans are dead end hosts for MERS-CoV.
False. Humans are the transiemt host. There is limited human to human transfer. Humans are technically not dead end host because humans can not sustain the pathogen. There is human to human transmission occasionally. Therefore not every human infection is a dead end.

4. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-Cov infections is approx. 65%.
False. The CDC stated that it is approx. 35% with limited household and healthcare transmission (CDC). There is no further evidence that backs up the claim that it is 65%. 

5. The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak.
False. It is a sporadic spillover from camels to humans. A point source is not the pattern that this disease follows. it is described more as a propagated outbreak with cases sporadically occuring. 

6. Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occured? Discuss possible ecological epidemiological and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend. 
It could be possible that people are aware of the infection since scientist and experts know about its transmission. It is likely that high risk individuals protect themselves when working with camels that could potentially be exposed to MERS. Better precautions are likely being taken now and camels are also being protected through vaccines, etc. Healthcare workers could have learned how to properly use PPE to protect themselves from picking up the virus.
