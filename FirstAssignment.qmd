## First Assignment

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

**The epidemiological triad helps explain how diseases spread, but it only shows one pathway. There are three parts to it: the agent, the host, and the environment.**

1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. Answer : 59 for 5%

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

A. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

The sample size for a large population would require a larger sample size such as 299 for an infinite population.

B. 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample for a large population would require a smaller sample size such as 229 for an infinite population.

The higher prevalence reduces the sample size for part be.

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_\_ (\<,=,\>) \_\_\_\_%

Answer: \<1%

3/300 = 0.01 so 1%

Worksheet 3
1. A. Find the incidence on day 06/12/2025. 06/14/2025/. 06/15/2025
06/12/2025.  			6/56=0.107 new cases of elk per day 
06/14/2025/. 			2/43=0.0465 new cases of elk per day 
06/15/2025				0/41= 0 new cases of elk per day 

B. What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/2024 and 06/16/2025. What is the unit for prevalence ? 
06/13/2025			11 infected elk so 11/56= 0.196 cases per elk 
06/16/2025			6 infected elk so 6/56=0.107 cases per elk 

C. On which day is prevalence same as the incidence (except the untis)
06/12 and 06/16 were both 0.107

D. On which dday is the incidence lowest? 
06/15/25 was 0
